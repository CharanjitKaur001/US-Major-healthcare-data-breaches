#  Analysis of Major US Health Data Breaches

Objective: The aim of this project is to analyze the dataset of major US health data breaches and gain insights into the patterns and trends of such breaches. 
The project aims to answer questions such as the number of records and individuals impacted by the breaches, the types and locations of breached information, the types of entities affected, and the correlation between breach submission date and type/location of breached information.
The analysis can help healthcare organizations to better understand and mitigate their own risk when dealing with sensitive health data and improve their compliance with existing regulations regarding patient privacy and security protocols related to health data management.
